# Critical Technical, Trust, UX, and Stability Fixes

Date: 2026-07-18

## Scope

This implementation is limited to the approved critical fixes. It does not add tools, consolidate or rewrite articles, change branding, or change existing page URLs other than repairing the confirmed broken redirect.

## Implemented fixes

### Redirect

- Changed `/blog/handwriting-generator-for-assignments` to permanently redirect to `/blog/handwritten-notes-generator`.
- Reason: the destination exists and is the closest current match for users creating handwritten assignment or notes pages. The previous destination did not exist.
- Verification: source responds with HTTP 308; destination responds with HTTP 200.

### Lint and source quality

- Escaped confirmed apostrophes in the About page.
- Removed unused homepage components and associated imports.
- Replaced raw synchronous third-party script elements with supported Next.js script strategies.
- Full lint completed with zero errors and zero warnings.

### Custom 404

- Added an App Router `not-found.tsx` page using the existing visual language.
- Added actions for Home, Converter, Templates, and Blog.
- Verified an unknown URL returns HTTP 404 and includes `noindex`.

### Encoding

- Scanned source text by Unicode code point for common mojibake markers (`U+00C2`, `U+00C3`, `U+00E2`, and `U+FFFD`).
- No confirmed corrupted source characters remain. Valid punctuation, arrows, apostrophes, and ellipses were preserved.

### Service workers

- Searched the complete application for service-worker registration and references to `sw.js`.
- Neither root `sw.js` nor `public/sw.js` was registered or required by the application.
- Removed both dead duplicates. No active PWA/offline behavior was removed.

### Handwriting rendering and exports

- Added visible render-failure and export-failure messages instead of console-only reporting.
- Added retry and reset recovery actions.
- Added rendering and export status announcements for assistive technology.
- Added immediate export locking plus disabled states to prevent duplicate downloads.
- Added staged PDF/image export progress copy and success feedback.
- Added guarded handling for canvas allocation, rendering, image generation, and PDF memory failures.
- Added text-length, estimated-page-count, and large-document performance guidance without an arbitrary input limit.

### Mobile usability

- Changed mobile navigation to wrap within the viewport while preserving the desktop single-row layout.
- Increased key mobile navigation, preset, retry, and export controls to reasonable touch-target heights.
- Fixed a confirmed 320px overflow caused by the word/page counter.
- Browser checks at 320, 375, 390, 768, and 1440px found document width equal to client width and no navigation overflow.

### Accessibility

- Added a global visible `:focus-visible` treatment.
- Added reduced-motion handling for animations and transitions.
- Added primary-navigation labeling, meaningful form labels, live status/error regions, `aria-busy`, range values and readable range descriptions.
- Added an accessible description of the canvas preview and its current page state.
- Verified one H1 and one main landmark on the homepage at all tested widths.

### Third-party scripts

- Ezoic initialization uses `beforeInteractive` only for the required queue bootstrap; its external loader uses `afterInteractive`; Ezoic analytics uses `lazyOnload`.
- Google Analytics remains `afterInteractive` so pageview integration is retained without a raw render-blocking tag.
- AdSense remains enabled and uses `lazyOnload`.
- No required advertising or analytics integration was removed.

### Contact form

- Replaced the non-observable form post with a progressively enhanced FormSubmit AJAX flow.
- Added native required/email/minimum-message validation, submitting/success/error states, duplicate-submit prevention, reset/retry, focus recovery, a honeypot, minimum completion-time screening, provider CAPTCHA configuration, and a data-processing disclosure.
- Verified the production contact page returns HTTP 200, contains labeled fields, three required controls, and the honeypot.
- A real message was intentionally not transmitted during automated testing. Final inbox delivery and FormSubmit account activation/CAPTCHA behavior remain dependent on the external provider and require an owner-authorized live submission.

### Privacy accuracy

- Replaced absolute privacy claims with behavior-specific language.
- Clarified that handwriting text rendering is local while analytics, advertising, hosting/security telemetry, cookies, and contact-form data may be processed by third parties.
- Explicitly documented Google Analytics, AdSense, Ezoic, and FormSubmit behavior.

## Files changed

- `app/about/page.tsx`
- `app/contact/page.tsx`
- `app/globals.css`
- `app/layout.tsx`
- `app/not-found.tsx`
- `app/page.tsx`
- `app/privacy-policy/page.tsx`
- `components/ContactForm.tsx`
- `components/HandwritingTool.tsx`
- `next.config.ts`
- `public/sw.js` (removed)
- `sw.js` (removed)

## Verification results

- Production build: PASS (`next build`, 29 static/SSG routes generated)
- Lint: PASS (`eslint .`, zero errors/warnings)
- Type check: PASS (`tsc --noEmit`)
- Missing route: PASS (HTTP 404, custom page, `noindex`)
- Redirect: PASS (HTTP 308 to `/blog/handwritten-notes-generator`; destination HTTP 200)
- Responsive widths: PASS at 320, 375, 390, 768, and 1440px
- Browser console: no errors on the verified production homepage/contact/404 flow
- Encoding scan: PASS; no confirmed mojibake markers
- Service-worker reference scan: PASS; no registration or active dependency

## Remaining unresolved items

- Live contact delivery cannot be fully verified without intentionally sending personal/test data to the configured third-party provider and support inbox. Perform one owner-authorized production submission after deployment.
- Advertising/analytics network responses and consent behavior can vary by geography, blockers, provider account state, and production domain. Recheck them on the deployed domain using provider dashboards and a clean browser profile.
- Pre-existing modified blog screenshots were outside this implementation scope and were not included in this publication.
