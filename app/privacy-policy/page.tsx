          <p>
            HandwritingTool is designed so the text you enter into the converter is processed in your browser for the
            purpose of generating handwritten-style output. The application code does not send that handwriting text
            to a HandwritingTool application server or save it to a HandwritingTool account. This statement applies to
            the converter text itself; analytics, hosting, contact-form, and security providers may still
            receive technical or usage data when the website loads or is used. We do not ask you to enter sensitive
            personal information into the converter, and you should avoid pasting private, confidential, financial,
            medical, or highly sensitive text into any online tool.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may receive normal technical request information from your browser when pages load, such as IP-related
            network data, browser type, device information, and timestamps. This is common for websites and hosting
            services and is used for security, reliability, analytics, and troubleshooting.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-950">Information the Converter Does Not Ask For</h2>
          <p>
            HandwritingTool has no user account or payment system. The converter does not ask for your name, email
            address, payment details, or an uploaded identity document. Text entered in the converter is used in your
            browser to create the preview and export.

          <p>
            HandwritingTool and third-party services may use cookies, local storage, pixels, tags, or similar
            technologies. These technologies can help remember basic preferences, measure traffic, improve performance,
            understand feature usage, or support analytics.

          <p>
            You can control cookies through your browser settings. Disabling cookies may affect some website features or

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-950">Analytics</h2>
          <p>
            HandwritingTool uses Google Analytics to understand aggregate website traffic and usage patterns, such as
            pages visited, approximate location, device and browser information, and interaction events. Google may
            process identifiers and technical information according to its own policies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Analytics information is separate from the text entered into the handwriting converter. HandwritingTool
            does not intentionally send converter text to Google Analytics.
